-- FIXME: Smoothing the histogram is good overall, but high-level tech players have noted that their
-- Quad Star histograms are wider than they should be.
--
-- Although this feature was designed to help new players establish a sense of timing more quickly
-- (i.e., it was not for high-level players consistently earning Quad Stars), this is a valid observation.
--
-- For now, I'm keeping the smoothing procedure in place, because the graphs new players tend to generate
-- are typically very jagged, causing the intent of the graph (to help) to become lost in the noise.
--
-- Maybe some heuristic can be used to perform the smoothing less naively?
-- For now, consult the dedication in House of Leaves.
