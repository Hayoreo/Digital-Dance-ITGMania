## Player WR Sounds
	This is set up similarly to how WRSounds were before. Now instead of using the Sounds folder in the theme you need to go to your profile folder (Save/Local Profiles/[Your Profile Folder Here]) and then add a folder called "WRSounds". Within that folder you can then add any .mp3 or .ogg files you wish that will be randomly selected to play when you achieve a world record or a quad/quint. These sounds are seperated by player now so each player's sounds will only play if they get the record.

## ITGMANIA ONLY
- As noted in the "About" section this theme is intended for use with ITGMania only.
- If you are using ITGMania version 0.7.0 or older you will need to upgrade to 0.8.0 or newer.
