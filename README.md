# Digital Dance v1.0.7
This version I'm dropping SM5 support in favor of ITGMania.

# ------------ Differences from 1.0.5 ------------
- RPG7 support
- ITL 2023 support
- Mouse input and custom mouse cursor for some screens.
- Song search is now accessed via "Ctrl + F" on select music rather than through the sort menu.
- Song search now uses custom text entry fields for better control.
- Players can toggle whether jumps and hands count towards the NPS of a chart in the operator menu.

## SM5 Build Support
As noted in the "About" section this theme is intended for use with ITGMania only.

# -- General things to note --
- This theme is intended for home use only.
