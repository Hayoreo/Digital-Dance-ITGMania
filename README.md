# Digital Dance v1.0.55
This is a partial release of v1.0.6 which is going to be a huge update and I wanted a release with ITL support.

# ------------ Differences from 1.0.5 ------------
- ITL 2023 support!
- Mouse input and custom mouse cursor for some screens.
- Song search is now accessed via "Ctrl + F" on select music rather than through the sort menu.
- Song search now uses custom text entry fields for better control.
- Players can toggle whether jumps and hands count towards the NPS of a chart in the operator menu.

## Aspect Ratio Support

  * <strong>16:9</strong> (common)
  * <strong>16:10</strong> (Apple laptops, some LCD monitors)
  
The aspect ratio can be changed under *Graphics / Sound Options*.

## SM5 Build Support
As noted in the "About" section this theme is intended for use with SM5 only.
* <strong>SM5.1 Beta 2</strong> (This is what I have been using to make/test this theme.)
* <strong>ITGMania</strong>
* <strong>SM5.0.12</strong> (This should work in theory, but I haven't tested it extensively.)

# -- General things to note --
- This theme is intended for home use only.
