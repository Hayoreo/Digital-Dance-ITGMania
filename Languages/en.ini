# now we get into the longer explanations of options

[OptionExplanations]
# Top-level Service menu items
SystemOptions=Adust high-level settings like game type, theme, language, and more.
Key Joy Mappings=Map keyboard keys, panels, menu buttons, etc. to game functions.
Test Input=Test your dance pad/controller and menu buttons.\n\nIf one of your buttons is not mapped to a game function, it will appear here as "not mapped".
InputOptions=Adjust input options such as joystick automapping, dedicated menu buttons, and input debounce.
GraphicsSoundOptions=Change screen aspect ratio, resolution, graphics quality, and miscellaneous sound options.
ArcadeOptions=Change options typically associated with arcade games.
VisualOptions=Change the way lyrics, backgrounds, etc. are displayed during gameplay; adjust overscan.
AppearanceOptions=Change the way things are displayed during gameplay (lyrics, backgrounds, etc.).
AdvancedOptions=Adjust advanced settings for difficulty scaling, default fail type, song deletion, and more.
ThemeOptions=Adjust settings that only apply to this theme.
USBProfileOptions=Adjust settings related to USB Profiles, including loading custom songs from USB sticks.
AcknowledgmentsMenu=View acknowledgments and credits for Simply Love, StepMania, and more.
Clear Credits=Reset coin credits to 0.
GrooveStatsOptions=Manage GrooveStats settings.


# SystemOptions
Game=Change the current game type.\n\n• dance is 4-panel (DDR and ITG).\n• pump is 5-panel (Pump It Up).\n• techno is 8-panel (TechnoMotion).\n\nYou probably shouldn't use this for anything besides dance tbh.
Theme=Change the look and feel of StepMania.\n\nThemes often extend the base functionality of SM5 in unique ways.
Language=Choose your language.\nDigital Dance sort of officially supports:\n\n• English\n• Español\n• Français\n• Italiano\n• 日本語\n• Deutsch\n• Português Brasileiro (pt-br)\n\nOther languages may be better supported in other themes.
Announcer=Choose a gameplay announcer from this list of packs you have installed.
DefaultNoteSkin=Select the default noteskin to use when playing.\n\nThis can be changed by players if they wish in the Player Options menu prior to gameplay.
EditorNoteSkin=Select the default noteskin for Edit Mode.

# Visual Options
Set BG Fit Mode=Adjust how StepMania will display (scale, crop, etc.) backgrounds during gameplay.
Overscan Correction=Use this to adjust for overscan that might occur with your display.

# Graphics/Sound Options
VideoRenderer=Choose a rendering backend.  Depending on your OS, "opengl" may be the only option available here.\n\nd3d (Windows only) does not support some visual effects.  Many "mod charts" (for example, content from TaroNuke) are visually unplayable when using d3d.\n\nYou will need to restart SM5 if you change this for it to take effect.
SmoothLines=Toggle whether certain theme components are rendered with antialiased lines.
FastNoteRendering=If enabled, the z buffer is not cleared after every note.  This causes 3D noteskins to collide, but substantially improves performance in gameplay.
ShowStats=Display performance statistics in the upper right corner of the screen and show frame skips in the lower right.\n\nFPS = frames per second\nVPF = vertices per frame\n\nA high VPF count indicates that the theme is drawing complex things and requires better hardware (or better programming) to maintain a steady FPS.\n\nThis feature can be toggled at any time by pressing F3+6.
VisualDelaySeconds=Subtract or add this many milliseconds of visual delay to gameplay.\n\nNegative values can be used to compensate for an LCD TV with a lot of "lag" or latency.
AttractSoundFrequency=Set to 'Always' to play sounds every time during StepMania's attract sequence.\n\nSet to '2 Times' to play sounds every other attract sequence.\n\nSet to 'Never' if you are an arcade attendent slowly losing your sanity to the unending noise engulfing you.\n\nSimply Love does not have any attract sequence sounds, but this setting may impact other themes.

# Appearance Options
ShowNativeLanguage=Choose between displaying song titles in their native language or transliterating them when possible.\n\nThis only affects songs where the stepartist provided both #TITLE and #TITLETRANSLIT information.
ShowLyrics=Toggle the display of song lyrics during gameplay if they are available.\n\nLyrics can be provided on a per-song basis by using an .lrc file.
BGBrightness=Control how bright the background will appear during gameplay.\n\nLower values result in a darker background.  0% is completely black.
RandomBackgroundMode=• Off - Display the background(s) specified by the current song.\n\n• Random Animations – Show randomly selected items from the BGAnimations folder during gameplay.\n\n• Random Movies - Show randomly selected items in the RandomMovies folder during gameplay.
NumBackgrounds=Choose the number of random backgrounds that will cycle per song.\n\nIf Random Gameplay Backgrounds is 'Off', this has no effect.
Center1Player=Turn this option 'On' to center the notefield during gameplay when only one player is active.
ShowDancingCharacters=If you have dancing characters installed, players can choose one from the third PlayerOptions menu in Simply Love.\n\nOther themes may use the "Select" choice to show a Character Select screen, but Simply Love does not.\n\nIf you do not have dancing characters installed, this setting will have no impact in any theme.

# Arcade Options
EventMode=• Off - Play a specific number of songs per game.\n\n• On - Play as many songs as you want per game.  Play all day if you want; I'm not your mom. 🤷
CoinMode=• Home - Options are shown on the Title screen.\n\n• Pay - Title screen choices are hidden; players must insert credits before playing. Pay mode is only possible when Event Mode is "Off."\n\n• Free Play - Title screen choices are hidden; no credits required to play.
CoinsPerCredit=This setting only applies when Coin Mode is set to 'Pay'.\n\nSpecify how many coins are needed for one credit.
Premium=This setting only applies when Coin Mode is set to 'Pay'.\n\n• 'Off' means one player can play with one credit\n\nThe remaining two options are surprisingly self-explanatory.
SongsPerPlay=This limits the number of songs per game when Event Mode is set to 'Off'.
Long Time=This is the length at which a song counts as two rounds.\n\nSet this to 'Off' if you don't want any songs to count as two rounds.
Marathon Time=This is the length at which a song counts as three rounds.\n\nIf Songs Per Play is set to 2, any song that counts as three rounds will not appear as a choice.\n\nSet this to 'Off' if you don't want any songs to count as three rounds.
AllowMultipleHighScoreWithSameName=Set this to 'Off' to prevent a single player from dominating the high score list for a given song.  Each chart will only allow one of a given high score handle.\n\nSet this to 'On' if you own your machine and wish to track your own progress.
ComboContinuesBetweenSongs=If turned off, the combo will reset to 0 between each song.\n\nIf turned on, the combo will carry between songs (and between unique games if profiles are not in use, which is often the case...).
Disqualification=If turned off, players cannot be disqualified from earning high scores.\n\nIf enabled, certain conditions (CMod on charts with speed changes, disabling attacks on charts with attacks, etc.) will disqualify players from earning high scores.


# Input Options
OnlyDedicatedMenuButtons=• Use Gameplay Buttons - Navigate through the game using your dance pad.\n\n• Only Dedicated Buttons - Navigate through the game using dedicated menu buttons, presumably on an arcade cabinet.\n\nPlease ensure your menu buttons are mapped before changing this setting, otherwise you might get stuck.
ThreeKeyNavigation=Enable this if you only have three MenuButtons per player (e.g. a traditional DDR arcade cabinet).  Some UI elements will change to reflect this.\n\nWith this enabled, you can save screenshots in Simply Love at Evaluation by simultaneously pressing &MENULEFT; and &MENURIGHT;.
ArcadeOptionsNavigation=This impacts how option menus are navigated.\n\n• StepMania Style - &START; button moves to end.\n\n• Arcade Style - &START; button moves to next option line.
InputDebounceTime=Time that a panel takes to de-press.  Use this to deal with ghost steps that occur a few milliseconds after a real step.
AxisFix=Set this to "On" if you use a USB adapter to connect your dance pad and certain jumps (for example, Up-Down jumps, Left-Right jumps, etc.) always register as "Miss".  This may fix the issue.
#'

# Theme Options
AllowScreenSelectProfile=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Select Profile screen.\n\nThe Select Profile screen can be helpful if you have multiple local profiles.
AllowScreenEvalSummary=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Evaluation Summary screen.
AllowScreenNameEntry=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Name Entry screen.
AllowScreenGameOver=Set this to 'No' if you want to skip the Game Over screen.
AllowLateJoin=Set this to 'No' if you don't want another player to join your set while playing single.
JumpsHandsNPS=Set this to 'Yes' if you want jumps and hands to count towards NPS.
MouseInput=Set this to 'Yes' if you want to also be able to use the mouse to control some UI elements on screen.\n\nTurning this on will disable the OS mouse as we have to use a custom mouse cursor.\n\n(Requires SM to be reset)
HideStockNoteSkins=Set this to 'Hide' if you want to hide all NoteSkins that come with SM5 from the modifier menu.
RescoreEarlyHits=Allow early hits of Decents ands Way Offs to be rescored to better judgments.\n\nChanging this setting will require a game restart to take effect.

UseImageCache=Lua-based song wheels will run more smoothly with the ImageCache system on, but StepMania will use a LOT more RAM as a consequence. It is recommended that you have at least 8GB of RAM to use the ImageCache system.\n\nYou will need to restart StepMania after turning this setting on for it to take effect.

# USB MemoryCard Options
MemoryCards=Allow players to save preferences and personal high scores to USB drives.\n\nNote that you must configure your computer's OS (outside of StepMania) to mount USB drives a specific way first for this to work.\n\nConsult the Wiki on StepMania's GitHub for detailed instructions about this.\n\ngithub.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki
CustomSongsEnable=Allow custom songs to be loaded from USB profiles.
CustomSongsMaxCount=Use this to limit the number of songs that will be loaded from a given USB profile.
CustomSongsLoadTimeout=If loading a song from a USB takes more seconds than this, cancel it and make the player choose a different song.
CustomSongsMaxSeconds=If a song from a USB profile is longer than this many minutes and seconds, it will not appear as a selectable song.
CustomSongsMaxMegabytes=If a song from a USB profile is larger than this file size, it will not appear as a selectable song.

# Advanced Options
AllowW1=Enable or disable fantastic judgments.\n\n• Never - No fantastics, at all, ever.\n\n• Courses Only - Fantastics are only possible during courses (nonstop, oni, etc.).\n\n• Always - Fantastics are possible in normal gameplay as well as in courses.
DefaultFailType=• Immediate - Ends gameplay when all players run out of life.\n\n• ImmediateContinue - Fails players when they run out of life, but allows gameplay to continue.\n\n• EndOfSong - Lifebar will continue even after a player fails. After the song, failing is decided by the current lifebar (even if you already failed you can still "pass").\n\n• Off - Disables fail.
PercentageScoring=In other themes, this may impact whether dance points or percent scores are displayed.\n\nIn Digital Dance, percent scores are always shown, but this setting still impacts how high scores get ranked relative to one another.\n\nYou want this setting 'On'.
UseUnlockSystem=Enable or disable StepMania's unlock system.\n\nDigital Dance does not support the unlock system, and I don't know of any other theme that does.
AllowExtraStage=When enabled (and Event Mode is off), this allows players to earn extra stages after completing certain requirements.\n\nThis presumably impacts other themes, but has no bearing on Digital Dance.
HiddenSongs=Simfiles with #SELECTABLE:NO; will not appear in the MusicWheel, but might be accessible via specific courses.\n\nLeave this 'Off' to always display all songs.
EasterEggs=Enable or disable some secret surprises a theme author may or may not have embedded in the theme.
AllowSongDeletion=Allow players to permanently delete songs from the computer by pressing Control + Backspace when browsing the MusicWheel.\n\n NOTE: Because of the custom lua wheel in Digital Dance this option doesn't do anything at the moment.

# GrooveStats Options
EnableGrooveStats=Establish a connection to GrooveStats.
AutoDownloadUnlocks=Auto-Download Unlocks for Online Events.\n\nNote: Unzipping the unlock can cause the game to stutter.
SeparateUnlocksByPlayer=Separate Downloaded Unlocks for Each Profile.

# ScreenPlayerOptions
SpeedModType=Change the way arrows react to changing BPMs.
